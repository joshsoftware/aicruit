## 1. MVP Objective

Deliver an AI-powered candidate screening system where HR can publish job descriptions, candidates can apply with resumes, and the AI automatically extracts, scores, and ranks candidates - enabling HR to review a ranked list and schedule interviews for top candidates.

**Core value**: Replace manual resume screening with AI-driven candidate ranking.

---

## 2. Success Criteria

The MVP is complete when:

1. HR can create a JD (with document upload), review AI-extracted data, edit if needed, and publish
2. Candidates can browse published jobs and apply (guest, no account required) with a resume
3. AI extracts structured data from JDs and resumes, scores candidates 0-10, and ranks them
4. HR can view ranked applicants sorted by AI matching score with score breakdown
5. HR can shortlist or reject candidates and schedule interviews (direct invite)
6. Candidates can create an account to track application status
7. Confirmation email is sent on application submission
8. All file downloads use signed URLs (no public file access)

**MVP Seeding**: The first company, admin user, and default roles are created via a seed script. Full user/company management UI is post-MVP.

---

## 6. User Journeys

### Journey 1: HR Creates and Publishes a JD

1. HR logs in → navigates to "Create Job"
2. Enters job title → requests upload URL → uploads PDF/DOCX document directly to S3
3. Submits form with `document_key` → System creates JD record (status: `draft`)
4. Background: AI worker extracts structured data from document
5. Frontend polls for completion → shows extracted data when ready
6. HR reviews extracted fields, edits if needed
7. HR clicks "Publish" → system validates title + required_skills exist
8. JD status changes to `published` → appears on public job board

### Journey 2: Candidate Applies (Guest)

1. Candidate browses published jobs (no login required)
2. Selects a job → views details
3. Enters name, email, phone → requests upload URL → uploads resume PDF directly to S3
4. Submits form with `resume_key` → System creates ghost user + application record (status: `applied`)
5. Confirmation email sent to candidate (with opt-in link to create account)
6. Background: AI worker extracts resume data → matches against JD → scores candidate
7. Application status updated to `screened`

### Journey 3: Candidate Creates Account

1. Candidate clicks opt-in link from confirmation email (or registers directly)
2. Creates account with email and password
3. Ghost user upgraded to registered user - existing application(s) linked
4. Candidate can view application status from dashboard

### Journey 4: HR Reviews Candidates

1. HR opens applicant list for a JD
2. Sees ranked list sorted by AI matching score (default: descending)
3. Can sort by score, date, name, experience
4. Can filter by status, score range, experience range
5. Clicks a candidate → sees full detail with score breakdown
6. Reviews matched skills (green), missing skills (red), experience timeline
7. Shortlists or rejects the candidate

### Journey 5: HR Schedules Interview & Hands Off to AI-Screening Service

> **Architectural Note**: AI-Screening is being developed by a separate team. Need to take a call on whether AI-Screening will be maintained as an independent microservice or integrated as a modular component within the AICruit Platform monolith.

**AICruit Platform:**
1. HR selects a shortlisted candidate.
2. HR schedules the interview with a date and time.
3. The system creates an interview record (`status: scheduled`).
4. The system sends a `POST` request payload to AI-Screening, passing the candidate's resume summary, JD summary, and experience details.

**AI-Screening Service:**
5. Screening service receives the payload and generates a unique session with a meeting link.
6. An email is sent to the candidate containing the meeting link and scheduled time.
7. The service pre-generates 10-15 targeted interview questions based on the candidate/JD summaries and stores them in its database (e.g., NoSQL).

### Journey 6: Candidate Joins AI Video Interview (AI-Screening Round)

1. The candidate clicks the meeting link and joins the interview at the scheduled time.
2. A human (HR) may optionally join the same interview session.
3. The interview session is created and started.
4. The AI interviewer greets the candidate and begins asking the pre-generated questions.
5. The candidate and AI interviewer speak in turn.
6. The session ends upon time completion.
7. The meeting transcription is saved to the Phase 2 database.
8. An interview screening output is generated based on performance metrics.

9. Screening service sends the candidate's final evaluation report back to AICruit Platform to update the candidate's final status and submit the report.

## 7. Technology Decisions

| Component | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Backend framework** | FastAPI (Python) | Async-native, auto-generated OpenAPI, Pydantic aligns with JSONB schemas, strong LLM SDK support |
| **Frontend framework** | React (JavaScript) | Team familiarity, rich ecosystem, SPA model fits this product |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | JSONB support required for AI-extracted data, proven reliability |
| **Message broker** | Redis | Serves as both broker and result backend, simple setup |
| **Task queue** | To be evaluated: Celery, Dramatiq, ARQ | Redis-backed. Final choice during implementation setup |
| **LLM provider** | OpenAI (GPT-4o) primary, explore alternatives | Strongest structured JSON output. Ollama option for local dev to avoid API costs |
| **Email service** | SendGrid or Resend | Simple API, free tier for MVP volumes |
| **Object storage** | S3-compatible (MinIO for local dev) | S3 API is the standard. MinIO for Docker-based local dev |
| **Repository structure** | Monorepo | Simplifies coordination during early development |
| **Containerisation** | Docker | Mandatory per architecture - same images across all environments |
| **Audit logging (MVP)** | Minimal status change logging | Records who changed what status and when. Full audit_logs schema deferred |

---

## 8. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Scaffolding, auth, database, Docker setup

- Project scaffolding (FastAPI + React)
- Docker Compose setup (backend, worker, PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO)
- Database migrations (companies, roles, users, user_roles)
- Seed script (first company, admin user, default roles)
- JWT auth (register, login, refresh, logout, forgot/reset password, me)
- RBAC middleware
- Basic health check endpoint

**Testable outcome**: User can register, login, get token, access protected endpoint.

### Phase 2: JD Pipeline

**Goal**: JD creation → AI extraction → HR review → publish

- JD CRUD endpoints
- Pre-signed S3 URL generation for document upload
- Background worker: `parse-jd` task (document parsing + LLM extraction)
- JD status machine (draft → processing → draft_parsed → published → closed)
- Publishing gate validation (title + required_skills)
- Polling endpoint for frontend status checking
- Frontend: JD creation form, extraction review page, publish flow

**Testable outcome**: HR uploads a JD document → AI extracts data → HR reviews and publishes → JD appears on public job list.

### Phase 3: Application Pipeline

**Goal**: Candidate applies → AI scores → application ranked

- Public job browsing endpoints
- Guest application endpoint (no auth)
- Ghost user creation
- Pre-signed S3 URL generation for resume upload
- Background worker: `parse-resume` task → chained `match-candidate` task
- Matching score calculation and denormalisation
- Application status machine
- Duplicate application prevention (composite unique constraint)
- Signed URL generation for file downloads
- Frontend: public job list, job detail, application form, polling for processing

**Testable outcome**: Candidate applies → AI scores resume → application appears in HR's ranked list.

### Phase 4: HR Review & Scheduling

**Goal**: HR reviews candidates → shortlists/rejects → schedules interviews

- Applicant list endpoint with sort/filter/pagination
- Application detail endpoint with score breakdown + signed resume URL
- Status actions (shortlist, reject) with minimal audit logging
- Interview scheduling - Option A (direct invite)
- Candidate account creation (register + ghost user upgrade)
- Candidate application status view
- Frontend: ranked applicant list, detail page, status actions, interview scheduling form, candidate dashboard

**Testable outcome**: HR views ranked list → opens detail → shortlists → sends interview invite → candidate receives email.

### Phase 5: Polish & Deploy

**Goal**: Edge cases, emails, error handling, deployment

- Application confirmation email (send-email task)
- Error handling for all failure scenarios
- Rate limiting on public endpoints
- CORS configuration
- Input validation refinement
- Malware scanning integration
- End-to-end testing
- Deployment configuration

**Testable outcome**: Full user journey works end-to-end in a staging environment.

**MVP Entities**: companies, roles, users, user_roles, job_descriptions, applications, interview_schedules, email_templates (seeded)

---

## 11. External Integrations

| Service | Purpose | MVP Config | Local Dev Alternative |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| **LLM (OpenAI)** | JD extraction, resume parsing, matching | `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var | Ollama (optional, to reduce API costs) |
| **Object Storage (S3)** | JD documents, resumes | `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | MinIO container in Docker Compose |
| **Email (SendGrid/Resend)** | Confirmation, interview invites | `EMAIL_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` | Console logging or Mailhog container |
| **Message Broker (Redis)** | Task queue for async processing | `REDIS_URL` | Redis container in Docker Compose |

---

## 12. AI Workflows

> Full pipeline details, prompt engineering tables, and scoring formula are documented in [AI_PROCESSING.md](../architecture/AI_PROCESSING.md).

**MVP Constraints**:
- LLM provider: OpenAI GPT-4o (configurable via env var)
- All prompts return structured JSON matching the JSONB schema
- Prompt versioning: store prompt template version in task metadata for traceability
- Matching score formula: `(skills × 0.40 + experience × 0.35 + education × 0.25) × 10`
- `parse-resume` auto-chains to `match-candidate` - no manual trigger needed

---

## 13. Error Handling

| Scenario | Expected Behaviour |
|----------|-------------------|
| AI extraction fails (LLM timeout/error) | Retry 3× with exponential backoff. On final failure: status → `extraction_failed`, HR notified in-app, retry button shown |
| File too large (>10MB) | Rejected directly by S3 via pre-signed URL constraints |
| Invalid file type | Handled by worker: fails task, status → `extraction_failed` |
| Malware detected | Handled by worker: fails task, status → `extraction_failed`, file deleted |
| Duplicate application (same email + same JD) | Reject with 409, clear error message |
| Network retry (duplicate submission) | `Idempotency-Key` header returns original response |
| LLM returns invalid JSON | Retry (treated as task failure). After max retries, DLQ + status = failed |
| Ghost user email matches existing user | Application linked to existing user automatically |
| Publishing without required_skills | Reject with 422, explain what is missing |
| Unauthorized access to another company's data | 403 (RBAC enforces company-scoped queries) |

---

## 14. Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests (Required for MVP)

- Matching score formula (all weight combinations, edge cases with 0 scores)
- JD status machine (all valid transitions, reject invalid)
- Application status machine (all valid transitions, reject invalid)
- RBAC permission checks (each role, company isolation)
- File validation (MIME type, magic bytes, size)
- Ghost user creation and linking logic

### Integration Tests (Required for MVP)

- JD creation → AI extraction → status update (mocked LLM)
- Application submission → resume parsing → matching → scoring (mocked LLM)
- Full JWT lifecycle (register → login → refresh → logout)
- Duplicate application rejection
- Company-scoped data isolation (cross-company access denied)

### AI Quality Tests

- AI regression fixtures: fixed JD + resume pairs with expected score ranges
- Verify extracted fields match expected structure
- Verify matching scores are within acceptable ranges for known inputs

> Full testing strategy is documented in [SYSTEM_DESIGN.md](../architecture/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) §13.
